Arnold: Yo guys, what do you think is the best headphones brand out there?

Rachel: Well, that's a pretty subjective question, Arnold. There are so many great headphone brands out there!

Sam: Yeah, and it really depends on what you're looking for too. Are you looking for noise-canceling headphones? Or maybe something with incredible base?

Arnold: Hmm, I hadn't thought about that. I was just looking for the brand that delivers the best sound quality.

Rachel: Well, I personally love Bose headphones. They're known for their high-quality sound and noise-canceling abilities.

Sam: I disagree. I think Beats by Dre are the way to go. They have great bass and sound quality, plus they look super cool.

Arnold: I don't know guys, I've heard that Sennheiser headphones are the best out there. They have a reputation for producing clear and natural sound.

Rachel: See, this is why it's hard to say which brand is the best. Everyone has their own opinion and preferences.

Sam: Yeah, but at the end of the day, it comes down to which headphones sound the best to you personally.

Arnold: You're right. I just need to try them out for myself and see which ones I like the most.

Rachel: Definitely. And hey, at least we can all agree that Apple's earbuds aren't the best option out there!

All three students laugh.
