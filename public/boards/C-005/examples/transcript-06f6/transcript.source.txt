Arnold: I think the best way to make weeks pass more slowly and make the most out of our time is to focus on enjoying every moment and not rushing things. We can do this by living in the present and taking the time to appreciate the things we have in our lives.

Rachel: While that may be true, I think we need to be more productive with our time. Instead of just enjoying the present, we should also set goals and work towards them. This way, we can feel like we are accomplishing something each week and the time won't feel like it's moving too quickly.

Sam: I agree with Rachel. We should definitely set goals and work towards them, but we should also make sure to take breaks and enjoy ourselves along the way. I think finding a balance between productivity and relaxation is the key to making the most out of our time and making the weeks feel longer.
