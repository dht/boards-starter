Arnold: Have you guys heard about digital nomads?

Rachel: Yeah, they're basically people who can work from anywhere as long as they have a laptop and internet access.

Sam: I have a friend who's a digital nomad and travels the world while working remotely.

Arnold: That sounds amazing! Do they have to work specific hours or can they work whenever they want?

Rachel: I think it depends on their job and their employer, but typically they have more flexibility.

Sam: Exactly, but it also requires a lot of self-discipline and organization to balance work and travel.

Arnold: I can imagine, but it sounds like a dream to be able to work while exploring new places.

Rachel: It definitely has its pros and cons, but it's definitely a growing trend in the modern workforce. 

Sam: I could see myself trying it out in the future, but for now, I think I'll stick to a more traditional office job.
