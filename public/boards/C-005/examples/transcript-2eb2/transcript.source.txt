Arnold: "What We Do in the Shadows is hands down the best vampire mockumentary ever made! I mean, the way it blends humor and horror is sheer genius. And the characters? They are hilarious!"

Rachel: "I disagree. I think it's just another generic vampire flick. Yeah, it has some funny moments, but it's not as good as people make it out to be. It's just a bunch of vampires trying to adapt to modern life, and it gets old pretty quickly."

Sam: "You guys are both wrong. It's not just a vampire mockumentary; it's a clever critique of society and our obsession with immortality. The characters are so well-developed, and the special effects are amazing. Plus, the scene where they go out to a nightclub is comedy gold!"

Arnold: "Exactly! The nightclub scene is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. And don't get me started on the bat-fight scene. That was epic!"

Rachel: "Okay, I'll admit that the bat-fight scene was pretty cool. But still, I don't think it's as good as people say it is."

Sam: "Well, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. But to me, What We Do in the Shadows is a modern classic that every horror and comedy lover should watch at least once." 

Arnold: "Agreed! It's a vampire tale that brings something new to the genre, and the humor is cleverly interwoven throughout the movie. It's definitely worth watching." 

Rachel: "I still disagree, but I can see why people might like it. It's just not my thing."
