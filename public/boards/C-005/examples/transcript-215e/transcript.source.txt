Arnold: Hey, have you guys heard about the recent discovery on Mars?

Rachel: No, what is it?

Arnold: Apparently, NASA found evidence of water on Mars.

Sam: Wow, that's impressive.

Rachel: Wait, are you serious? That's not true.

Arnold: What do you mean? I read an article about it yesterday.

Rachel: I don't think that's true. There hasn't been any recent news about water on Mars.

Sam: Yeah, I haven't heard anything about that either.

Arnold: Well, I'm pretty sure it's real.

Rachel: You shouldn't believe everything you read online. Always fact-check your sources.

Sam: Yeah, it's important to make sure you're getting accurate information.

Arnold: Oh, I see what happened. I accidentally read a fake news article.

Rachel: Ah, that makes more sense.

Sam: It's always a good idea to double-check information before sharing it with others.

Arnold: Thanks for letting me know. I'll be more careful in the future. 

Rachel: No problem, it happens to all of us.
